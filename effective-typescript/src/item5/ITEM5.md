## Item 5: Limit Use of the `any` Type

### Things to Remember
TypeScriptâ€™s any type allows you to disable most forms of type checking for a symbol.

The any type eliminates type safety, lets you break contracts, harms developer experience, makes refactoring error prone, hides your type design, and undermines confidence in the type system.

Avoid using any when you can!
