## Item 6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System

### Things to Remember
Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that supports them.

Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how TypeScript infers types.

Familiarize yourself with TypeScriptâ€™s refactoring tools, e.g., renaming symbols and files.

Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.
