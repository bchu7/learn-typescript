## Item 9: Prefer Type Annotations to Type Assertions

### Things to Remember
Prefer type annotations (: Type) to type assertions (as Type).

Know how to annotate the return type of an arrow function.

Use type assertions and non-null assertions only when you know something about types that TypeScript does not.

When you use a type assertion, include a comment explaining why itâ€™s valid.
