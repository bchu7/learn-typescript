## Item 13: Know the Differences Between `type` and `interface`

### Things to Remember
Understand the differences and similarities between type and interface.

Know how to write the same types using either syntax.

Be aware of declaration merging for interface and type inlining for type.

For projects without an established style, prefer interface to type for object types.
