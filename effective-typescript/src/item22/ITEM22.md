## Item 22: Understand Type Narrowing

Understand how TypeScript narrows types based on conditionals and other types of control flow.

Use tagged/discriminated unions and user-defined type guards to help the process of narrowing.

Think about whether code can be refactored to let TypeScript follow along more easily.
