## Item 24: Understand How Context Is Used in Type Inference

### Things to Remember
Be aware of how context is used in type inference.

If factoring out a variable introduces a type error, maybe add a type annotation.

If the variable is truly a constant, use a const assertion (as const). But be aware that this may result in errors surfacing at use, rather than definition.

Prefer inlining values where itâ€™s practical to reduce the need for type annotations.
