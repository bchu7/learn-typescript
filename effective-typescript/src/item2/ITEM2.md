## Item 2: Know Which TypeScript Options You're Using

### Things to Remember
The TypeScript compiler includes several settings that affect core aspects of the language.

Configure TypeScript using tsconfig.json rather than command-line options.

Turn on noImplicitAny unless you are transitioning a JavaScript project to TypeScript.

Use strictNullChecks to prevent “undefined is not an object”-style runtime errors.

Aim to enable strict to get the most thorough checking that TypeScript can offer.
